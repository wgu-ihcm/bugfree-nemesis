I wish I was a duck; then I could quack on demand.
And nobody would stare wondering why I quacked,
because hey, that's what ducks do.

Hmm.  What if I used the web editor for this?

That's potentially powerful.  Would I even need to clone this to my local computer?

What if we just built it from here?

That's possible.  We'd need a pull server to provision this to a web server to check progress.

Ah, that's the rub.  Where to go to check on progress.  

My cat keeps trying to sneak past me on the porch to climb the stairs and explore.
